 * This class is part of the "NolsPotLex" application. "NolsPotLex" is a
 * very simple, text based adventure game.
 * 
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user. A
 * command currently consists of two parts: a CommandWord and a string (for
 * example, if the command was "take map", then the two parts are TAKE and
 * "map").
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid command
 * words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not known) then
 * the CommandWord is UNKNOWN.
 * 
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
